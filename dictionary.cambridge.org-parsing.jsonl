The most commonly used word is avoid . Avoid swimming in areas where sharks are known to congregate. If someone evades something, they manage to avoid or escape from it.

Dodge is a more informal word meaning evade . He tried to dodge his military service. You can say that someone runs away from or, especially in writing and more formal spoken contexts, shrinks from a problem or difficult situation. These expressions are often used in negative sentences. I didn't often run away from difficult decisions. I've never been one to shrink from a challenge. If you sidestep or shirk a duty or responsibility, you avoid it. Shirk is a disapproving word. This is not a responsibility you can sidestep. Some Democrats have accused him of shirking his duty. If you skip or miss something that you usually do or that you have arranged to do, you avoid doing it. Skip is informal. Is your child skipping school? Depressed patients often miss therapy appointments. If you get out of something unpleasant, such as a job you are supposed to do, you manage to avoid it. I managed to get out of washing-up duties."}
